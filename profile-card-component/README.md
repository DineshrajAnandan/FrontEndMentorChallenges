## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I have got an experience working with CSS Grid and CSS background properties.

The code below was helpful to set the position of the background images for different screen sizes.
```css
body {
  font-family: 'Kumbh Sans', sans-serif;
  background-color: hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
  background-image: url(./images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
    url(./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
  background-position: right 50vw top -90vh, left 50vw top 41vh;
  background-origin: border-box, border-box;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

I need to understand more about the CSS styling properties and CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This helped me understand the background CSS property.
